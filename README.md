# Talk: Your journey from data science to animated web graphics

I gave this talk at [posit::conf(2024)](https://posit.co/conference). You can see the [uploaded slides](https://positconf2024.talks.jamesgoldie.dev), or use this repo to rebuild them yourself with [Quarto](https://quarto.org):

> This talk uses fantasy backgrounds under licence from [Czepeku](https://czepeku.com). The backgrounds are not distributed with this repository, so if you rebuild the slides locally you will see solid colour slide backgrounds instead.
